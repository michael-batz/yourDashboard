# yourDashboard
yourDashboard is a webbased dashboard engine written in PHP. You can define multiple dashboards using a XML configuration file. Each dashboard consists of one or multiple dashlets, that will be reloaded in a configurable time interval using AJAX technology. yourDashboard comes with a few dashlets (for OTRS and OpenNMS), but it is easy to write your own dashlet, too.
